            This website is dedicated to a few birds that I personally love.
            There is no particular order to the list, as the love I feel for
            birds cannot be quantified.

        Harpy Eagles are so big I bet I could get one to hug me.

        Ospreys kind of remind me of Vash the Stampede from the classic anime Trigun

        I firmly believe that humanity has done a great disservice to ravens, 
        in much the same way that we have done a disservice to pigeons. People
        trained pigeons to carry letters great distances very quickly but we
        set them all free when we no longer needed them. Although people never
        truly domesticated ravens like we did pigeons, these highly intelligent
        birds are known to cooperate with wolf packs so that they can get the 
        leftovers of a fresh hunt. Ravens <em>want</em> to be our friends but we never 
        let them.

        Shrikes are kind of hilarious, because they're so small and yet so vicious.

        I find mynahs to be interesting because they do not typically have what I would call a "bird accent".
        Where parrots speak with the much stereotyped "squawk" and most corvids have at least a noticable 
        accent that I would describe as an "uncanny valley" effect where it's difficult to describe what's 
        off, like hearing an analog recording, and do occasionally speak with a distinctly crowing accent, 
        Mynahs are notable for the fidelity of their immitations. With parrots and corvids, one can often 
        quickly tell that it is a bird speaking despite their imitative skill, but mynahs are capable of 
        repeating a sound exactly as we would hear it. They do have that particular birdlike way of speaking
        some of the time, but they are capable of reproducing a wide variety of noises.
